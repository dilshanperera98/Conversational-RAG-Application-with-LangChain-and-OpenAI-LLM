# 🗨️ Conversational RAG Application with LangChain and OpenAI LLM

I recently built a **Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot** that enhances information retrieval by leveraging **LangChain** and **OpenAI's LLMs**.  
This chatbot processes and extracts relevant insights from uploaded documents (e.g., **CVs, reports, PDFs**), enabling **intelligent and context-aware** conversations.

## 🚀 Key Steps

### 1️⃣ Project Setup  
- Install required dependencies and set up the environment.

### 2️⃣ Load and Process Documents (PDFs)  
- Extract meaningful text data from uploaded documents.

### 3️⃣ Split Text into Chunks  
- Improves retrieval accuracy by breaking content into manageable pieces.

### 4️⃣ Create a Vector Store with ChromaDB  
- Enables **semantic search**, retrieving relevant content based on meaning rather than keywords.

### 5️⃣ Define the Chatbot's Behavior  
- Ensures responses use only **relevant document data**, avoiding hallucinations.

### 6️⃣ Create a RAG Pipeline  
- Retrieves relevant information **before** generating answers, ensuring accuracy.

### 7️⃣ Test the Chatbot  
- Verifies that the chatbot retrieves **correct information** from the document.

### 8️⃣ Add Conversational Memory (Context Awareness)  
- Ensures follow-up questions stay within context.

### 9️⃣ Create a Conversational RAG Chain  
- Enables **session-based chat**, allowing users to continue conversations seamlessly.

### 🔟 Final Test with Conversation Memory  
- The chatbot **remembers past interactions** and improves responses over time.
